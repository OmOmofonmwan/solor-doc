        <title>What is LOINC®?</title>
        <para>Bodenreider et al. provide an overview of LOINC®: </para>
        <para><emphasis>Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC®) is a clinical
                terminology for identifying health measurements, observations, and documents. LOINC®
                was initiated in 1994 by the Regenstrief Institute, a non-profit medical research
                organization associated with Indiana University. By 1994, many electronic systems
                were sending clinical information as discrete results using messaging standards such
                as Health Level Seven (HL7) or ASTM 1238 (American Society for Testing and
                Materials). Inside these messages, laboratories and clinical systems used local,
                idiosyncratic names and codes to identify which test was being reported. This was
                problematic for data exchange and aggregation because of the large resources it
                takes to map codes between every participating system.</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis>To solve this problem, Regenstrief organized the LOINC® Committee to develop
                a common terminology for laboratory and clinical observations. Existing
                terminologies were not granular enough, focused on coding for billing rather than
                clinical results delivery, or did not fit with the messaging models being used.
                Because such a standard did not exist, the LOINC® Committee embarked on creating a
                terminology with [an] appropriate level of granularity for defining the names of
                observations used in laboratory and clinical information systems. Since its
                creation, LOINC® has continued to be developed and published by the Regenstrief
                Institute as a freely available global standard with a set of implementation tools.
                Today, LOINC® is used by a diverse global community who propel its continuous
                development.</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis>LOINC's® primary role is to provide identifiers and names for observations.
                Here, observation [is used] as a generic term for health data represented in a
                particular way. In different domains, these might be called tests, variables, or
                data elements. Within and among health IT systems, observations are communicated
                with a structure that has two key structural elements. The first element identifies
                what the observation is, e.g., diastolic blood pressure, hematocrit, tobacco smoking
                status. The second element carries the result value of the observation, e.g., 80
                (mmHg), 40 (%), or “current everyday smoker”. When used together, these two elements
                carry the instance of a specific test result for a given patient. A common pairing
                is to use LOINC® as the standard code for the observation, and SNOMED CT as the
                standard code for the observation value when needed. This approach is endorsed by
                the developers of both terminologies and fits their design
            purpose.</emphasis></para>
        <para><emphasis>Some mistakenly believe that LOINC® is only for laboratory tests. It is true
                that the first release of LOINC® in May 1995 contained only terms for laboratory
                testing, but by December of 1996, LOINC® had already added about 1,500 clinical
                measurement terms (vital signs, ECG measures, etc). Now, more than 20 years and 60
                releases later, LOINC® has grown significantly in other domains, including
                radiology, standardized survey instruments and patient-reported outcomes measures,
                clinical documents, nursing management data, and nursing assessments. The LOINC®
                Committee itself is now composed of three major composite committees: Laboratory,
                Clinical, and Radiology. </emphasis>[1]</para>
        <section>
            <title>LOINC® Current State</title>
            <para>Regenstrief continues to update LOINC® and publish twice-yearly releases. New
                concepts are added to LOINC® based on submissions from end users. The current
                version contains more than 99,000 terms covering the full scope of laboratory
                testing (chemistry, microbiology, molecular pathology, …etc.) and a broad range of
                clinical measurements (e.g., vital signs, ECG, patient-reported outcomes, …etc.). In
                addition to distributing the terminology, Regenstrief makes available at no cost a
                variety of supporting tools and resources, including the Regenstrief LOINC® Mapping
                Assistant (RELMA®) and online search application.</para>
            <para>LOINC® uses a semantic data model containing six major and up to four minor
                attributes to create fully-specified names for concepts. The major attributes of the
                LOINC® name are:</para>
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>component (e.g., what is measured, evaluated, or observed)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>kind of property (e.g., mass, substance, catalytic activity)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>time aspect (e.g., 24-hour collection)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>system type (e.g., context or specimen type within which the observation
                        was made)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>type of scale (e.g., ordinal, nominal, narrative)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>type of method (e.g., procedure used to make the measurement or
                        observation).</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>The atomic elements that make up each LOINC® term name are called “Parts” and are
                also assigned identifiers. The combination of attribute values produce term names
                that are [intended to be] detailed enough to distinguish among similar observations.
                Of the six attributes, only the method is optional and used only when necessary to
                distinguish among clinical important differences. </para>
            <para>“A fully specified test result or clinical observation can be described formally
                with the following syntax: &lt;Analyte/component>:&lt;kind of property of
                observation or measurement>:&lt;time aspect>:&lt;system
                (sample)>:&lt;scale>:-&lt;method>” [2]</para>
            <para>Over time, LOINC® has not only grown in size, but also developed additional data
                structures and content around its main codes for individual observations. The LOINC®
                release contains a basic hierarchy that organizes LOINC® codes into a set of is-a
                relationships. LOINC® now has a detailed model for representing enumerated
                collections of observations, such as laboratory panels (complete blood count),
                assessment instruments (e.g., PHQ-9), data sets (National Trauma Data Standard), and
                forms (e.g., U.S. Standard Birth Certificate). This content is published in a
                special release artifact called the LOINC® Database, with the current version
                (August 2022) containing more than 99,000 terms. LOINC® also has a detailed model
                for connecting observation terms to structured answer lists. These answer lists can
                be defined by extension or intension and linked to observation terms with different
                types (e.g., example, preferred, normative). This content is published in the LOINC®
                Answer List File, with the current version (August 2022) containing links between
                25,640 unique LOINC® terms and 4,341 unique answer lists composed of coded LOINC®
                Answers, and including mappings to other terminologies such as SNOMED CT where they
                exist. LOINC® now also publishes the atomic elements (called Parts) that make up
                each LOINC® term name. The LOINC® Part File includes the Part identifiers and names,
                links between Parts and LOINC® terms, and mappings from LOINC® Parts to other
                terminologies such as SNOMED CT and RxNorm where they exist.</para>

            <para>The following <emphasis role="italic">italicized excerpts</emphasis> provide an

                of LOINC®. Non italicized text reflects updates and discussion to reflect the
                current state. </para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Regenstrief is committed to working with developers of
                    health data standards that are complementary to LOINC®, including syntax
                    standards for data exchange and other terminology standards. Regenstrief and HL7
                    have a long-standing collaboration; a few joint work highlights include clinical
                    genomics guides, claims attachments specifications, and approaches for
                    representing vocabulary standards in Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources
                    (FHIR) terminology services. Regenstrief Institute made core LOINC® content
                    available via a FHIR API as part of its normal release process beginning Summer
                    2018.</emphasis></para>
            <para>In April 2022, a LOINC Terminology Service using the FHIR Standard was launched
                with an API that provides a means for users to access LOINC content across multiple
                versions programmatically.]</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Regenstrief and the IEEE Standards Association, developer
                    of the 11073™ standards, are collaborating to enhance the interoperability of
                    traditional medical devices and personal health devices. Regenstrief is an
                    active member of the Health Standards Collaborative (HSC) which provides an
                    executive forum for senior leadership of the U.S. healthcare standards
                    development community to improve interoperability. In 2017, Regenstrief worked
                    with the IVD Industry Connectivity Consortium (IICC) on a specification for
                    publishing vendor IVD tests associated with a set of LOINC® codes that identify
                    the distinct observations produced by the test.</emphasis></para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">In the context of the specifications of the U.S.
                    Meaningful Use incentive program, LOINC® is the primary choice for specifying
                    attributes, and SNOMED CT the system of use for the relevant attribute values.
                    In other words, LOINC® is used to specify the question (e.g., 29308-4: “what is
                    the diagnosis?”), and SNOMED CT to specify the answer (e.g., 3723001:
                    “Arthritis”). Adoption of this principle by both the Regenstrief Institute and
                    SNOMED International has formed the basis for the cooperation agreement. In
                    2013, Regenstrief and SNOMED International formed a long-term collaborative
                    relationship to link the rich clinical semantics of SNOMED CT to LOINC®, which
                    provides extensive coverage of laboratory tests and clinical measurements.

            <para>While the initial partnership and memorandum of understanding signed between
                SNOMED CT and LOINC<emphasis role="italic">® </emphasis>developers paved the way for
                development teams to facilitate interoperability and minimize duplication of effort,
                the collaborative relationship did not accomplish a complete integration of the two
                disparate terminologies. Further integration has been proposed to leverage SNOMED
                CT’s model for the representation of LOINC building blocks and for a more consistent
                representation of clinical and laboratory observations in SNOMED CT. Furthermore,
                the use of description logics for the representation of LOINC was not accomplished
                under this initial partnership in 2013 and only SNOMED CT currently uses this
                formalism. LOINC still uses its distinct formalisms and tools for its
                representation, has its own release cycles and versioning mechanisms, which makes
                seamless integration with SNOMED CT non trivial, if possible at all. </para>

        <title>What is SNOMED CT®?</title>
        <para>Bodenreider et al. provide an overview of SNOMED: </para>
        <para><emphasis role="italic">Since the inception of the Structured Nomenclature of
                Pathology, SNOP, in 1965, the various versions of SNOMED have developed both in
                terms of content and underlying representation. Development of content is clearly
                illustrated by the number of elements in the various systems. SNOP comprised “about
                15,000 distinct medical objects, processes, and concepts”. It developed further into
                SNOMED-2, and later SNOMED International, which contained 150,000 concepts in the
                mid-1990s. Its successor, SNOMED Reference Terminology (SNOMED RT), contained over
                120,000 active concepts. The initial version of SNOMED CT, the merger of SNOMED RT
                and the UK-based Clinical Terms Version 3, released January 2002, consisted of
                278,000 active concepts, a number that has grown to 350,000+ in the January 2022
                release of SNOMED CT. The representation has gone through phases of increasing
                formal rigor. The initial SNOP and SNOMED versions were multi-axial systems that
                enabled post-coordination. Whereas SNOP started as a 4-axis system, SNOMED
                International had expanded to using 12 axes: anatomy (topography), morphology
                (pathologic structure), normal and abnormal functions, symptoms and signs of
                disease, chemicals, drugs, enzymes and other body proteins, living organisms,
                physical agents, spatial relationships, occupations, social contexts,
                diseases/diagnoses and procedures. SNOMED RT abandoned the use of self-standing axes
                that could be combined into composite codes in favor of a description logic
                formalism called Ontylog, based on the Knowledge Representation System Specification
                (KRSS) syntax and the K-REP system. Following contemporary naming conventions for
                description logics, the set of constructors used corresponds to the
                </emphasis><emphasis role="italic">ℰℒ ++ language. SNOMED CT has continued to use
                this description logic as its underlying representation. The evolution of the
                representation of “arthritis” through the history of SNOMED provides an illustration
                of editorial changes over time, with examples from SNOMED-2, SNOMED International,
                and the current version of SNOMED CT.</emphasis> [1]</para>

            <title>SNOMED CT® Current State</title>
            <para>Regarding the current state, Bodenreider, et al., go on to say:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Since the first release of SNOMED CT in January 2003,
                    updated versions have been released twice a year. Maintenance can lead to a
                    decrease of the number of elements, e.g., in January 2010 when, among others,
                    the veterinary content was removed from the International Release.
                </emphasis>[1]</para>
            <para>The July 2022 release contains 356,817 active concepts, 1,202,379 active
                relationships and 1,286,456 active descriptions. The largest categories of concepts
                in SNOMED CT are disorders (23%), procedures (16%), body structures (11%), clinical
                findings other than disorders (10%), and organisms (9%). In SNOMED CT parlance,
                descriptions are labels that describe the concepts, not textual definitions of the
                concept, of which SNOMED CT contains 9762. </para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">A significant design criterion for SNOMED is to keep
                    concept expressions simple enough to be broadly usable by clinicians, while
                    maintaining faithful representation of concept meaning. Validity of concept
                    expressions is determined by adherence to the concept model underlying SNOMED
                    CT. This concept model specifies which types of relationship are allowed for
                    which concepts, and what the allowed values are. For example, the concept model
                    specifies that “Method” is an allowed attribute relationship for “Procedure”
                    concepts, for which the value should be a type of “Action”. The January 2018
                    release uses 82 relationship types, almost twice the number of the initial 42
                    relationship types. Since July 2017, the concept model is available in
                    machine-readable form, and distributed as separate tables which are part of the
                    semi-annual releases. Other tables provide mappings to several versions of the
                    International Classification of Diseases (ICD9-CM, ICD-10 and ICD-O). The
                    current release format, called Release Format 2 (RF2), supports versioning,
                    providing access to any previous release of SNOMED CT.</emphasis></para>
            <para>While SNOMED CT has made much progress in their use of description logics, and
                have also provided a tool on github, snomed-owl-toolkit [3], to facilitate the
                conversion and classification process, the official distribution of OWL refsets has
                yet to be seen. It seems one reason is the lack of current clinical systems to
                utilize them at this time [4]. </para>

            <title>SNOMED CT® Collaborations</title>
            <para>Here’s an excerpt of what Bodreider et al. have to say about Collaboration
                Initiatives:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">SNOMED CT is not developing in isolation, but increasingly
                    collaborating and harmonizing with other relevant standards in the area of
                    structured and standardized storage and exchange of biomedical data. This
                    includes mapping, as well as binding of information model and terminology.
                    Mappings are maintained between SNOMED CT and a number of terminology systems.
                    These include the World Health Organization (WHO) classifications (e.g.,
                    versions ICD-10 and ICD-O of the International Classification of Diseases), as
                    well as the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2), the
                    International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP), and LOINC. The latter
                    is especially important in the context of the specifications of the U.S.
                    Meaningful Use incentive program, in which LOINC is the primary choice for
                    specifying attributes, and SNOMED CT the system of use for the relevant
                    attribute values. In other words, LOINC is used to specify the question (e.g.,

                    3723001: “Arthritis”). Adoption of this principle by both the Regenstrief
                    Institute and SNOMED International has formed the basis for a cooperation
                    agreement in 2013.</emphasis></para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">SNOMED CT also has collaborations for specific domains. In
                    the context of rare diseases, collaboration with Orphanet leads to harmonization

                    Medical device terminology is addressed in collaboration with the Global Medical
                    Device Nomenclature Agency (GMDNA). Finally, Kaiser Permanente’s Convergent
                    Medical Terminology (CMT) provides concepts and descriptions to be considered
                    for inclusion. Moreover, SNOMED CT forms the backbone for the development of
                    national extensions by member countries of SNOMED International. National
                    extensions typically contain concepts that are important in a given country, but
                    not in scope for the international release of SNOMED CT. Other extensions, such
                    as the veterinary extension, contain content specific to a given community of

        <title>What is RxNorm®?</title>
        <para>Here’s an excerpt of Bodenreider et al. overview of RxNorm:</para>
        <para><emphasis role="italic">At the dawn of the twenty-first century, there was no standard
                terminology for drugs in the U.S.. While many companies provide information about
                drugs for use in clinical information systems (e.g., to support clinical decision),
                each drug knowledge base defines its own codes and names for medications, making it
                difficult to exchange information across clinical information systems and to
                retrieve information from different systems. For example, the same transdermal patch
                delivering 0.583 milligrams of nicotine per hour for 24 hours (e.g., to help with
                smoking cessation) is referred to with the following codes and names in three of the
                major drug knowledge bases: • 2707 nicotine 14 mg/24 hr transdermal film, extended
                release • 102712 Nicotine 14 MG/24 HR Transdermal Patch, Extended Release • 016426
                NICOTINE 14 mg/24 hour T R A N S D E R M PAT C H , TRANSDERMAL 24 HOURS In addition
                to capitalization differences, there is a lack of standardization in naming dose
                forms (transdermal film vs. transdermal patch) and units (24 hr vs. 24 hour), making
                it difficult to parse names from multiple systems. RxNorm was created to address the
                lack of standardization in drug names, and to make drug terminologies interoperable
                by integrating them into a reference system. Since the 1990s, the National Library
                of Medicine (NLM) has released the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a
                terminology integration system in which names and codes from all major biomedical
                terminologies are integrated, and equivalent terms across vocabularies are
                identified. RxNorm can be thought of as a specialized version of the UMLS. While
                both UMLS and RxNorm are built upon existing vocabularies, one major difference
                between the two is that UMLS generally does not create names for biomedical
                entities. In contrast, RxNorm creates a “normal form” for every drug entity it
                integrates. In RxNorm parlance, normal forms are standardized terms for drug
                entities. For example, the normal form for the nicotine patch discussed above is “24
                HR Nicotine 0.583 MG/HR Transdermal System”, to which RxNorm permanently assigns the
                concept unique identifier 198029. Unlike the UMLS, RxNorm also defines a rich
                network of named relationships among the various types of drug entities it
                integrates (e.g., ingredient, brand name, generic drug product, branded drug
                product). The main use cases RxNorm was designed to support include electronic
                prescribing, drug information exchange, and mapping across drug vocabularies (e.g.,
                for medication reconciliation purposes). Standard names and codes for drugs were
                also expected to facilitate the development of standard clinical decision support
                rules involving medications. RxNorm started in 2002. It was first released through
                the UMLS and has been published as an independent terminology with monthly releases
                since November 2004, and weekly updates since 2008 to reflect drugs recently
                marketed in the U.S. market. The number of sources integrated in RxNorm has grown
                from 5 to 13.</emphasis>[1]</para>

            <title>RxNorm® Current State</title>
            <para>Bodenreider et al. go on to talk about the current state:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Sources. RxNorm currently integrates terminology
                    information from most drug knowledge base vendors (e.g., First DataBank, Multum,
                    Micromedex, Gold Standard), as well as the drug component of standard
                    terminologies (e.g., SNOMED CT, MeSH). RxNorm also integrates sources from
                    several U.S. federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
                    Structured Product Labels, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) National
                    Drug File, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Formulary
                    Reference File, as well as the list of vaccines administered (CVX) maintained by
                    the National Center of Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for
                    Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More recently, RxNorm has also integrated
                    international drug resources, such as the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)
                    Classification System and DrugBank, a drug resource used in many research
                    projects. </emphasis></para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Organization. The RxNorm drug model distinguishes between
                    generic and branded drug entities and identifies three major definitional
                    elements for drug products, namely ingredient, strength, and dose form, along
                    with two additional elements, quantity factor and qualitative distinction. The
                    major types of drug entities include ingredient (e.g., Azithromycin), brand name
                    (e.g., Zithromax), clinical drug (e.g., Azithromycin 250 MG Oral Tablet), and
                    branded drug (e.g., Zithromax 250 MG Oral Tablet). Generic and branded packs are
                    collections of clinical and branded drugs, respectively (e.g., Z-PAK, a branded
                    pack of 6 tablets of 250 milligrams of azithromycin). While drugs are sold
                    mostly pre-packaged in some countries (e.g., individual tablets in blister
                    packs), packs are available for a minority of drugs in the U.S. In addition to
                    the six major drug entities, RxNorm provides entities for navigational purposes.
                    Clinical and branded drug components associate ingredient (or brand name) and
                    strength information, and clinical and branded dose forms associate ingredient
                    (or brand name) and dose form information.</emphasis></para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">The various types of drug entities in RxNorm are organized
                    into a graph that can be easily traversed, enabling users to navigate among
                    types of entities (e.g., to find the branded drugs associated with a given
                    ingredient). While its main organization principles have remained centered on
                    the ingredient-strength-dose form triad, RxNorm has added definitional features
                    to accommodate distinctions, such as duration for extended release forms and
                    transdermal systems (e.g., the quantity factor “24 HR” in “24 HR Nicotine 0.583
                    MG/HR Transdermal System”) and size of unit of presentation for injectable
                    medications (e.g., the quantity factor “40 ML” in “40 ML Ciprofloxacin 10 MG/ML
                    Injection”), as well as qualitative elements for specific drugs (e.g., the
                    qualitative distinction “Sugar-Free” in “Sugar-Free Cholestyramine Resin 4000 MG
                    Powder for Oral Suspension”). A drug product in RxNorm is fully defined by its
                    set of ingredient, strength, dose form, quantity factor, and qualitative
                    distinction values. Types of ingredients include multi-ingredients (e.g.,
                    Sulfamethoxazole / Trimethoprim) and “precise ingredients” (e.g., Atorvastatin
                    calcium, Morphine Sulfate), generally denoting, salts, esters, and complexes of
                    base substances. As illustrated in the examples above, RxNorm normal forms
                    reflect the definitional features of drug entities. Additionally, RxNorm
                    explicitly links drug entities to these features, which supports efficient
                    processing. For example, the generic nicotine patch “24 HR Nicotine 0.583 MG/HR
                    Transdermal System” is linked to its ingredient (Nicotine), strength (0.583
                    MG/HR), dose form (Transdermal System), and quantity factor (“24 HR”).

            <para><emphasis role="italic">The scope of RxNorm is different from that of drug
                    knowledge bases. RxNorm focuses on drug names and codes. In other words,
                    clinical information (e.g., indications, drug classes, and drug-drug
                    interactions) and administrative information (e.g., drug pricing) are out of
                    scope for RxNorm. Although it integrates international sources (e.g., ATC,
                    DrugBank), RxNorm focuses on drug products marketed in the U.S. Finally,
                    non-therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, bulk powders, contrast media, food,
                    dietary supplements, and medical devices, such as bandages and crutches, are all
                    out of scope for RxNorm. In addition to the codes from drug terminologies and
                    knowledge bases, RxNorm integrates codes from the FDA’s National Drug Code (NDC)
                    Directory, which serve as product identifiers for drugs in billing transactions,
                    and contains links to Structured Product Labels (i.e., package inserts)
                    submitted by drug manufacturers to the FDA. </emphasis>[1]</para>
            <para>The September 2022 edition of RxNorm includes 13856 (base) ingredients, 5065 brand
                names, 17226 semantic clinical drugs, 9424 semantic branded drugs, 474 generic
                packs, and 543 branded backs. </para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">With each monthly update, the RxNorm content is kept
                    current and in sync with drugs available on the U.S. market, i.e., new drug
                    products are added and drug products no longer available are retired. RxNorm
                    identifiers are never reused and can be safely used as permanent identifiers for
                    drugs in clinical data warehouses and prescription datasets. However, any given
                    release of RxNorm only contains detailed information about active drug products
                    in that release.</emphasis></para>

            <title>RxNorm® Collaborations</title>
            <para>In regards to RxNorm collaborations, Bodenreider, et al. has this to say:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">In the development of RxNorm content, NLM has worked in
                    close collaboration with the vendors of drug knowledge bases, with federal
                    partners, and with representatives of the pharmacy services industry represented
                    by NCPDP. Similarly, the development of RxNav and the RxNorm API have greatly
                    benefited from the feedback provided by their user community. For the past five
                    years, NLM has held an annual DailyMed/RxNorm Jamboree Workshop to bring
                    together the RxNorm stakeholders. To extend the usefulness of RxNorm despite its
                    limited scope, NLM has also initiated partnerships with providers of clinical
                    information that can be linked to RxNorm. For example, NLM has developed
                    companion APIs to link RxNorm drugs to various drug classification systems and
                    to publicly available sources of drug-drug interaction information. Drug classes
                    for RxNorm drugs can also be explored through the RxClass
                    application.</emphasis></para>

                meet the needs of its users. SNOMED CT is the only terminology that meets all the
                requirements as described by Cimino. However, as noted above, SNOMED CT has
                proprietary elements that limits it’s usefulness for interoperability.</para>

                system of concepts with assigned identifiers and human language terms, typically
                involving some kind of semantic hierarchy. Some systems may support the assignment
                of multiple terms, or synonyms, to a given concept; these may include terms in
                multiple natural languages, such as English or Dutch.” [10] This definition implies
                that knowledge representation for a terminology system may not always be based on a
                strict defining hierarchy. The advantage, or disadvantage, of such an approach is
                that the terminology, such as LOINC® for instance, might appear to be rather
                intuitive and human-readable and comprehensible. However, when delving into complex
                use cases, a lack of formal defining structure may reveal that it is difficult to
                understand the precise meaning of the terminological representations and that use of
                a system such as LOINC® may differ widely amongst humans. Further exacerbating
                potential variability is the heterogenous behavior of tools implemented to reason
                with terminological structures. [11] </para>
            <para>The field of Knowledge Representation and “Description Logics” was developed out
                of the attempt to formally define “intuitive representations” with a formal
                semantics to establish a common ground for human and tool interoperability.
                Knowledge representation involves the design of formalisms for expressing knowledge
                about a particular domain and focuses on representing and characterizing classes of
                objects and relationships between them. </para>
            <para>An ideal state terminology that relies on description logics may invoke more
                formal semantic relationships between and among concepts. Use of a Description
                Logics reasoner can help in overcoming important drawbacks of multi-axial systems
                and other non-standard, distinct formalisms: (1) the capability of detecting
                semantic equivalence of syntactically different expressions, and (2) the automated

            <title>SNOMED CT® Design Criteria</title>
            <para>Bodenreider et al. provide an overview of SNOMED Design Criteria:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">The representation of SNOMED has gone through phases of
                    increasing formal rigor. The initial SNOP and SNOMED versions were multi-axial
                    systems that enabled post-coordination. Whereas SNOP started as a 4-axis system,
                    SNOMED International had expanded to using 12 axes. SNOMED RT abandoned the use
                    of self-standing axes that could be combined into composite codes in favor of a
                    description logic formalism called Ontylog, based on the Knowledge
                    Representation System Specification (KRSS) syntax and the K-REP system.
                    Following contemporary naming conventions for description logics, the set of
                    constructors used corresponds to the EL ++ language. SNOMED CT has continued to
                    use this description logic as its underlying representation.</emphasis></para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">A significant design criterion for SNOMED is to keep
                    concept expressions simple enough to be broadly usable by clinicians, while
                    maintaining faithful representation of concept meaning. Validity of concept
                    expressions is determined by adherence to the concept model underlying SNOMED
                    CT. This concept model specifies which types of relationship are allowed for
                    which concepts, and what the allowed values are. For example, the concept model
                    specifies that “Method” is an allowed attribute relationship for “Procedure”
                    concepts, for which the value should be a type of “Action”. The January 2018
                    release uses 82 relationship types, almost twice the number of the initial 42
                    relationship types. Since July 2017, the concept model is available in
                    machine-readable form, and distributed as separate tables which are part of the
                    semi-annual releases. Other tables provide mappings to several versions of the
                    International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10 and ICD-O). The
                    current release format, called Release Format 2 (RF2), supports versioning,
                    providing access to any previous release of SNOMED CT.</emphasis> [1]</para>
            <para>While SNOMED CT has committed to an application of formal methods and rigor to its
                knowledge representation, others have explicitly rejected the value of description
                logic and chose not to provide a defining taxonomy or fully define LOINC®

        <para>Despite the guiding principles for terminology design and representation summarized
            above, “LOINC® does not fulfill the definition of a computable medical terminology as
            articulated by Cimino et al., that being one based in concept orientation, concept
            definition, and polyhierarchy. These characteristics enable the logical inference
            between concepts, parts, and part elements.” [12] LOINC® is a well-maintained
            terminology – there is a deprecation process and has concept permanence where codes
            aren’t reused – but they do not establish the basic parameters of hierarchy and
            polyhierarchy, they are violating the tenants of Cimino’s Desiderata.</para>

            <para>SNOMED CT® CT is the terminology, that we are currently aware of, that most
                closely aligns with the Desiderata. As stated elsewhere, it uses Description Logics
                for computability and facilitates the use of reasoners to determine equivalence
                among various syntactic representations. The primary downsides are 1). Some
                proprietary concepts and 2). Lengthy concept submissions process for consideration
                into either the National or International editions. This lack of agility, efficiency
                and speed is apparent in crisis situations such as COVID-19 pandemic. Otherwise, it

            <para>While RxNorm meets most of the Desiderata’s requirements, there are a few that are
                not met. Of particular importance is the lack of Description Logics. Use of a

                multi-axial systems: (1) the capability of detecting semantic equivalence of
                syntactically different expressions, and (2) the automated classification of
                concepts in a hierarchy. Another issue is that RxNorm is not a global standard as
                it’s development and main use is in the U.S. where it is a nationally recognized
                standard, ie Meaningful Use. </para>
            <para>However, recent work by Bona et al. [13] have been developing a Drug Ontology

                Ontology, which is a modular and extensible ontology of drug products, their
                ingredients and biological activity to enable comparative effectiveness and allow
                researchers to query National Drug Codes (NDCs) in multiple ways. Bone et al. go on
                to say the following:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">We have implemented a full accounting of national drug
                    codes and RxNorm unique concept identifiers as information content entities, and
                    of the processes involved in managing their creation and changes. This includes
                    an OWL file that implements and defines the classes necessary to model these
                    entities. A separate file contains an instance-level prototype in OWL that
                    demonstrates the feasibility of this approach to representing NDCs and RXCUIs
                    and the processes of managing them by retrieving and representing several
                    individual NDCs, both active and inactive, and the RXCUIs to which they are
                    connected. We also demonstrate how historic information about these identifiers
                    in DrOn can be easily retrieved using a simple SPARQL query.</emphasis></para>

                <para>While SNOMED uses explicit, elaborate axioms to clarify meaning, its complex
                    representation (compositional grammar) limits its broad adoption.[15] The
                    learning curve to appropriately learn, author, and represent concepts using
                    SNOMEDs compositional grammar (for post-coordinated expressions) and constraint
                    language is steep, resulting in few who want to spend the resources to learn. In
                    addition, even for those who learn it, it takes substantial experience to
                    develop the expertise to understand and demonstrate concept redundancy in a

                    harm from low data quality. While part of the reason for this is SNOMEDs
                    constant improvement / refinement, specifically in improving and standardizing
                    concept representation, this still makes it difficult for the user to determine

                    metrological guidelines. Measurement uncertainty is invaluable in the correct
                    interpretation of measurement results. [15] Because interpretive comments can be
                    of crucial importance in patient care, the need to expand SNOMED to thoroughly
                    capture these concepts is critical.</para>

                <title>Inconsistent Selection of Codes for the Same Test</title>
                <para>Without concepts of polyhierarchy, concept orientation, and concept
                    definition, there is additional pressure on technicians and other actors to
                    correctly specify the correct LOINC® code: “When the terminology model is
                    ultimately weak, it forces more onto the [statement] model”. [16]. “A challenge
                    that remains to be solved is the binding of statement model and terminology.
                    There is often no clear demarcation between what is represented in the statement
                    model and what is represented in the terminology.” [9] </para>
                <para>Consequently, laboratory technicians may select a LOINC® code with an
                    incorrect part (i.e., the incorrect specimen or analyte) due to LOINC’s®
                    multiaxial hierarchy, resulting in difficulties for data aggregation and
                    understanding across both different technicians and institution. [12] It has
                    been reported that choosing different ‘properties’ (i.e., parts) was the most
                    frequent reason that different coding choices were made. [17] In a “study about
                    correctness of LOINC® mapping, choosing different ‘Method’, ‘Scale’ and
                    ‘Property’ attributes was the most common reason for different coding choices
                    among three large institutions. For example, in the ‘Method’ axis, some
                    institutions usually use a code that specifies the method (when available),
                    whereas other institutions always choose terms that are “methodless”. Another
                    example, is that in the ‘Scale/Property’ axes, LOINC® uses two distinct styles
                    (Prid:Nar VS. Prid:Nom) for reporting the interpretation of laboratory tests
                    (e.g. CFTR gene mutation analysis). The Narrative (Nar) scale is for free text
                    results (sentences, paragraphs, sections), whereas the Nominal (Nom) scale is
                    used for representing coded values, as when selecting an organism found on
                    culture from a coded list of bacteria. The differences between these types are
                    often subtle and require understanding the reporting system. Steindel et al.
                    also concluded that for some purposes, such as finding any code that could be
                    used to indicate the presence of a particular disease, rolling up LOINC® codes
                    and ignoring some LOINC® axes (e.g. method, scale, or property) can be
                    beneficial.” [17]</para>
                <para>There is not much management in terms of education in what codes are used for,
                    and medical technicians often do not have the LOINC® level of knowledge for
                    encoding that is necessarily expected. [18] The results in the following example
                    offer insight into how different codes may be selected for the same test from
                    different laboratories. </para>

                    States Department of Health and Human Services for SARS-CoV-2 reporting and
                    harmonizes how IVD test information is represented using LOINC®. The LIVD file
                    format is currently led by IVD Industry Connectivity Consortium (IICC), and the
                    JSON representation is a project at HL7. </para>
                <para>To quantify the magnitude of problems that the lab data ecosystem faces, the
                    FDA funded a pilot evaluation with five healthcare systems that found LOINC®
                    data maintained only 59% integrity as it moved from laboratory analyzer to
                    laboratory information system [20]. Efforts to promote interoperability using
                    LOINC® and related standards will require a more comprehensive effort and
                    continuing evaluation and quality control.</para>

                <title>Quality Assurance in LOINC® Using Description Logic</title>
                <para>Although LOINC® has not officially adopted Description Logic and formal
                    knowledge representation languages, the U.S. National Library of Medicine
                    applied Description Logic to the quality assurance of LOINC® (based on the 2013
                    collaborative agreement) and used it as a basis for auditing LOINC® [21]. This
                    study helps demonstrate the usefulness of Description Logic for terminologies
                    [21] by producing the following findings: </para>

                <para>Overall, these results suggest decent quality maintenance for LOINC as these
                    counts are relatively small considering the 450k+ concepts in LOINC as part of
                    this study. However, the key takeaway from this body of work is that LOINC could
                    benefit from the application of Description Logic by allowing for automated
                    classification and equivalence detection. </para>

                    exchanged between systems for many uses. The LOINC® Document Ontology represents
                    the five key attributes of clinical documents that intend to be understood

                <para>A semi structured interview conducted by consultants to the FDA with pathology
                    experts produced a finding that the “LOINC® document ontology appears to be
                    irrelevant to move things – not many people use it. It was a first attempt to
                    apply some relationships between LOINC’s® concepts that formally don’t exist
                    now, but it’s in a domain that has low impact. [22]</para>

                <para>LOINC’s® website currently hosts ‘The Hierarchy Browser’ tool which allows
                    users to view various hierarchies located in LOINC®. Much of this functionality
                    was previously only available in the RELMA application. [23] While a good
                    starting point towards formal knowledge representation, the current hierarchies
                    are limited, and still do not provide full definitions for LOINC® parts.
                    Furthermore, the use of the hierarchies and LOINC parts are very restricted

                        Center (Nebraska Medicine) has maintained an extension namespace (extension

                        the course of their daily work. This content has been deployed in records

                        Observables project of the IHTSDO and Regenstrief Institute published a
                        draft convergent concept model for harmonization of content between LOINC®
                        and SNOMED CT®. In January 2017 the project published a set of SNOMED CT®
                        formatted expressions which define the meaning of ~13000 laboratory LOINC®
                        observables employing the harmonized concept model. An expanded technology
                        preview of ~20000 concepts has been released by the IHTSDO but is not
                        included in this publication. UNMC has converted the earlier expression set
                        into SNOMED CT® formatted extension concepts employing LOINC® long names as
                        the SNOMED CT® fully specified name and assigning class supertypes within
                        the Observable entity hierarchy in SNOMED CT®. ‘Grouper’ concepts have been
                        modeled and deployed within the Observable entity hierarchy in order to
                        enhance clinical navigation and to support common query use cases in
                        laboratory medicine and pathology. Anatomic and molecular pathology
                        observables defined by semantic analysis of the CAP Annotated Cancer
                        Protocols explained in 3.3 are included. Some pre-existing SNOMED CT®
                        Observable entity content has been fully defined using the harmonized
                        concept model with permission of the IHTSDO. Grouper concepts have been
                        included to organize the ontology and support common query use cases
                        proposed by CAP. All content was run through the description logic
                        classifier and both ‘stated’ and ‘inferred’ relationships are included in
                        this release. This “Observables ontology” for laboratory medicine and
                        pathology is being published for evaluation and comment by the informatics

                <para>The Nebraska Lexicon is a pragmatic example of harmonizing terminologies into
                    a single concept model and melding LOINC and SNOMED together. The content is

                    expands beyond just LOINC and SNOMED, but that could also represent additional
                    terminologies such as RxNorm, CVX, etc. (i.e., HL7’s Terminology Knowledge
                    Architecture) would allow users to integrate content and changes more seamlessly

                <para>Current quality control of LOINC® is limited or not known. While the
                    aforementioned Quality Assurance study proved that use of Description Logic is
                    promising and beneficial for terminologies such as LOINC®, these types of
                    quality assurance methods are not widely used. </para>
                <para>The only published quality metrics from Regenstrief about LOINC® include
                    published stats about their submission queue describing how long it takes to
                    create a LOINC® term (e.g., 182 days to turn around a revision). [26]</para>
                <para>Regenstrief relies on an occasional survey (either once per year or once every
                    few years) from ONC to the laboratory community to assess how labs are using
                    LOINC®, what are the barriers, etc.; however, the survey is very LOINC®-centric
                    and not so much about the quality of the terminology standard itself. </para>
                <para>LOINC® is user-driven, so all submissions are coming from the community. This
                    is beneficial in that there is transparency and openness to the curation of
                    content. However, the current curation is inadequate, and there is no systemic
                    approach to ensure no overlap between terms. </para>
