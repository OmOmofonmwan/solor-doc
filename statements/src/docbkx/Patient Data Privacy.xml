    <title>Patient Data Privacy</title>
    <section>
        <title>Important of Patient Data Privacy</title>
        <para> Patient data privacy refers to patients’ legal protection of their personal health
            information by healthcare providers. All healthcare professionals must protect the
            confidentiality and integrity of patients’ health information, while simultaneously
            providing patients access to their data, including medical histories, test results,
            treatments, and other personal information collected during patient interactions.
            Patient data privacy stems from the branch of medical ethics that focuses on
            doctor-patient confidentiality and is critical for building trust and ensuring patients
            feel confident disclosing important information about their health. As well as having
            access to their data, patients also have the right to correct any errors in their record
            and to allow others to access their health data. These rights are protected both by the
            medical code of ethics and the law, with violations leading to legal penalties. Several
            laws exist in the United States and abroad to advance patient data privacy, including
            the following: </para>
        <para>• Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (United States) [1]:
            Protects the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of health information. HIPAA
            provides patients with a legal right to access and receive copies of their personal
            health data upon request and is broken down into Privacy, Security, and Breach
            Notification Rules: </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Privacy Rule:</emphasis> The Privacy portion of HIPAA dictates
            that health care providers and health plans must provide access to protected health
            information (PHI) in “designated record sets”. These record sets are maintained by the
            provider and contain all information collected or stored by the healthcare entity,
            including paper records, data in electronic systems, remote/archived information, or
            data pertaining to where the PHI originated. It also ensures that patients can access
            and edit their records if they find an error. [2] </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Security Rule:</emphasis> Healthcare providers must enact
            safeguards to protect PHI and ensure that PHI data is not improperly disclosed. Several
            measures including access control tools, encryption, and audit trails are types of
            security measures that can be built into systems containing PHI. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Breach Rule:</emphasis> Federal law requires doctors, hospitals,
            and other health care providers to notify patients and the Secretary of Health and Human
            Services if a breach of PHI security occurs. If a breach affects more than 500 residents
            of a state or jurisdiction, the health care provider must also notify prominent media
            outlets serving the state or jurisdiction. </para>
        <para>• 21st Century Cures Act Information Blocking Rule [3]: Prohibits health information
            technology vendors from blocking exchange of health information or restricting patient
            access to such information. The information blocking rule within this act is of
            particular importance to patients because it includes provisions ensuring that patients
            can electronically access all their electronic health information (EHI), structured
            and/or unstructured, at no cost, and with the application of their choice. Patients have
            the recourse to report information blocking by healthcare systems and other vendors. [4] </para>
        <para>• Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act : Advanced data privacy for
            patients’ Substance Use Disorder (SUD) records and mandated that Health and Human
            Services (HHS) issue guidance during the COVID-19 Pandemic regarding sharing patients’
            protected health information (PHI). [5] </para>
        <para>• General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): An EU policy that safeguards all personal
            data including healthcare data. It grants patients’ rights over their data and mandates
            healthcare organizations provide data protection measures. This policy extends beyond
            the EU and protects EU citizens wherever they are globally. [6, 7] </para>
        <para>Several key principles outline the GDPR approach to data protection: </para>
        <para>o Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency </para>
        <para>o Purpose limitation </para>
        <para>o Data minimization </para>
        <para>o Accuracy </para>
        <para>o Storage limitation </para>
        <para>o Integrity and confidentiality </para>
    </section>

        <title>Patient Data Privacy and IKM</title>
        <para> IKM does not handle or store individual patient records, and therefore does not
            directly have authority over the security or dissemination of these records. IKM is a
            contributed knowledge management application that will serve as a quality care driver to
            improve healthcare data quality and support the downstream accuracy of patient
            treatments and public health decisions. The contributed IKM application provides a space
            for healthcare knowledge to be managed in a single centralized area and improves
            clinical support systems to help healthcare providers. While IKM does not directly
            handle or store individual patient records, it plays a vital role in preserving the
            integrity and quality of healthcare data that are transferred within and between systems
            in the healthcare labyrinth. </para>
        <section>
            <title>HIPAA v. GDPR and Patient Data Privacy</title>
            <para>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a law designed
                specifically to protect individuals’ medical information while General Data
                Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a broader regulation that encompasses protection of
                various types of personal data, including health data. However, both laws protect an
                individual’s right to the safe and secure handling of their personal information and
                are designed to protect an individual’s privacy. </para>
            <para>HIPAA rules only apply to covered entities including health care providers, health
                plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. Below are examples of each covered entity
                [8]:</para>
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Healthcare provider: doctors, clinics, chiropractors, nursing homes,
                        pharmacies</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Health plans: health insurance companies, HMOs, company health plans,
                        Medicare/Medicaid</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Healthcare clearinghouse: entities that process nonstandard health
                        information received from another entity into a standard. </para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>GDPR rules apply to “Controllers” and “Processors”. Controllers are typically the
                same as HIPAA Covered Entities, and generally <emphasis role="italic"
                    >collect</emphasis> personal information, whereas a Processor is similar to the
                HIPAA business associate and usually <emphasis role="italic">processes</emphasis>
                personal information. Unlike HIPAA, GDPR has extraterritorial reach to locations
                outside of the EU where EU persons personal information is in use. </para>
            <para>Most relevant to IKM is the GDPR rules that extend extraterritorial reach to
                personal data “processors” in the United States when the controller is in the EU,
                and has heightened protections for data concerning health, genetics, or biometrics.
                US healthcare providers can satisfy the GDPR security requirements for electronic
                personal data by complying with the HIPAA Security Rule or by following the security
                framework of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (from which
                the HIPAA Security Rule is based). </para>
            <para>Although IKM does not qualify under HIPAA as a covered entity, nor under GDPR as a
                controller or processor, IKM values patient data privacy and upholds the highest
                security standards. [9]</para>

        <title>Understanding Different Entities and Their Roles in Patient Data Privacy </title>
        <para>SNOMED CT® and LOINC® are similar to IKM as they do not directly handle patient data
            nor collect any PHI. Below are SNOMED CT® and LOINC®’s commitment to data
            privacy:</para>
        <section>
            <title><anchor xml:id="Toc158988554"/>SNOMED CT®</title>
            <para>SNOMED CT®’s statement on data privacy [10]:</para>
            <para>SNOMED CT® itself doesn't directly handle patient data privacy. However, it
                contributes indirectly to patient data privacy by providing a standard language for
                clinical data. SNOMED International Services provides a detailed description of
                Personal Data processed for the purposes of Analytics, Contacting the User, Hosting
                and other uses. The privacy policy also provides details of an individual’s rights
                to their data and how to access and control personal information, and even includes
                a point of contact for questions specifically concerning privacy. </para>

        <section>
            <title><anchor xml:id="Toc158988555"/>LOINC®</title>
            <para>As LOINC®’s privacy policy states in the <link
                    xlink:href="https://loinc.org/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy – LOINC</link>®,
                LOINC® does not collect any personal health information. LOINC® is a catalog of
                measurements that includes laboratory tests and clinical measures, that are not
                limited to vital signs and anthropometric measures, and standardized survey
                instruments. LOINC® also contains codes for the collection types for these items,
                such as panels, forms, and documents. [11]</para>

        <title> Conclusion</title>
        <para>Patient data privacy is an important aspect of delivering safe and effective
            healthcare and is protected by HIPAA and other laws. The EU’s General Data Privacy
            regulation ushered in an era of stringent and protective data privacy standards and have
            even influenced new policies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). [12]
            As we navigate the complexities of data privacy regulations, our team remain committed
            to protecting patient data and patient privacy. Though not directly governed by HIPAA or
            GDPR, we believe patient data privacy should remain at the forefront of our operations,
            reinforcing our commitment to quality healthcare.</para>
